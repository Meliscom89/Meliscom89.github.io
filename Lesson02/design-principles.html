          I really enjoy the alignment in this site. This layout reminded me of
          how the example for our assignment was set up. Everything is evenly
          spaced including the side margins. All the margins in this section of
          the website clean and appropriate for the content.

          The main repeating detail that I really like in this site is the
          repeating use of color. The colors that are used in their logo are
          repeated throughout the site. Tying the whole site together. I really
          like when companies do this. It makes it easier to visually see when
          you navigate away from their site.

        <img
          src="images/applePic.jpg"

          I feel that the Apple website overall, uses white space very well. The
          page on the new colored iMacs is an awesome example of this. You would
          think that a website advertising new more colorful products would not
          have a lot of white space. The large amount of white space in this
          particular site actually puts an emphasis on the color. The white
          space around each item is consistent and appropriate for the content.
          For example, the space between each image is the same on the top and
          bottom as well as the sides. The images themselves also use a good
          amount of negative space. All these elements combined create a very
          clean website.
