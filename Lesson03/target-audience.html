      <h3>Target Audience Description</h3>
      <p>
        The primary target audience lives in, or around the Bear Lake area,
        specifically in Preston, Soda Springs, and Fish Haven. Their ages range
        from people in their 20’s to people in their 50’s. They belong to the
        middle class and are college educated. They have little to no knowledge
        of weather patterns, much like the general public. They could be single
        or have families.
      </p>
      <h3>Personas</h3>
      <h4>Maggie(Persona 1)</h4>
      <p>
        Maggie is married to John and is a mother of two. She lives in Preston
        and is 41 years old. She has a college education. She is middle class.
        Maggie uses this site primarily on her phone or tablet in order to plan
        family outings.
      </p>
      <h4 id="rick">Rick(Persona 2)</h4>
      <p>
        Rick is 25 years old and single. He likes the outdoors and lives in Fish
        Haven. He has a college education but is still new to his career so he
        falls into a lower-middle class financially. He primarily uses the site
        on his phone, where he generally checks the weather around his favorite
        hiking trail.
      </p>
